            As a person who is open to innovations, believes in the importance of teamwork, and adopts that learning is lifelong, I continue my education and
individual studies in the field of Data Science. I have been interested in the field of Data Science throughout my education life, especially during my
academic studies, and I have been following the groundbreaking innovations in this field. I have worked with Bioinformatics analysis tools (in biology) and
programs such as SPSS and Matlab (in the biomedical field) by using different data sets during my master's degree and applied courses. I aim to become a
more operational expert by combining the knowledge I have gained from my biology and biomedical studies with my data science skills.
In the last 2 years, I attended paid and free Data Science training courses from online platforms (Coursera, BTK, Linkedin). I updated my knowledge level
with the courses I took at Gebze Technical University and I continue to take courses on the subjects I need. I learned Python, SQL, Data Pre-
Postprocessing, Data visualization, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit Learn, and I developed machine learning and deep learning models. I continue to expand my
studies. In addition, during my 13-month remote data analyst internship, I took part in projects such as Seller Clustering, Seller Churn Prediction, and
Category Finder Object Detection at OneAMZ. During this period, I had the opportunity to practice and apply the knowledge I learned. Especially in the
Churn Prediction project, we achieved 95% success. The Seller Churn Prediction project, where I was the team leader, was highly appreciated by the
company.
I have a bachelor's and master's degree in biology. I took biomedical science doctoral courses during my doctoral education in English Biomedical
Biomedicine, which I had to leave during the thesis period. In my business life, I gained experience in various positions such as Remote Data Analyst,
Logistics Officer, Sales Officer, Sales Representative, and Biology Teacher. With this experience, I am ready for a position where I can use my knowledge
and skills in the best way.
